When using this package with React Native (and only when using it with React Native!) this package relies on [@react-native-community/async-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-async-storage/async-storage) as a driver for localForage, so make sure to install it as well:

:::

```sh
yarn add @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

Or

```sh
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```
